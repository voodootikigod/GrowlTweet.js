GrowlTweet
==========

Why?
----

The simplest things are often the best. I couldn't stand the way twitter search was implemented in almost every Twitter client I tried. I wanted something that would just notify me if a search item was matched... Oh, and not use up 100% of my CPU doing it, yea that would be nice. 

Yes its incredibly stupid simple, yes I am taking the easy route and using curl to pull down images, yes I don't give a damn. It works, it gets out of my way, I love it.

Running
-------

To run

  > node growl\_tweet.js

Be sure to update your Twitter search query on line 5 of growl_tweet.js, oh and did you know you can use AND and OR to make it a single query that covers multiple searches, yea I didn't, but that rocks.

Requirements
------------

Obviously you need [growl](http://growl.info/) and [growlnotify](http://growl.info/extras.php#growlnotify) installed (brew install growlnotify). 

This library is vapor.js approved
